# Stock-Market-Prediction-A-Comparitive-Analysis-Between-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This paper presents comprehensive research on predicting the closing prices of Indian stocks, with a focus on the Nifty Bank Index. The study proposes a model designed to enhance investors' profitability through accurate predictions. A comparative analysis of various algorithms, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Linear Regression has been done by employing metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error and achieved high accuracy in forecasting the closing prices of Nifty Bank stocks. The findings indicate that the proposed model not only performs on par with existing methods but also delivers improved accuracy. This comparative analysis of different algorithms assists in identifying the most effective approach for predicting closing prices, thereby providing investors with more reliable tools for financial decision-making.
